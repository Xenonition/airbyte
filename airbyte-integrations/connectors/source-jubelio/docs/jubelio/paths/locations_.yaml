  summary: Create/Edit Location & Rack Plan
  description: >
    This API is used to create/edit location of the warehouse. You can also set
    your rack plan (using `layout` property), start from floor level, row
    number, column number and bin number. You are able to set your default
    warehouse staff (using `default_warehouse_user`), so later you can set for
    auto-putaway process after receiving inbound items. <br>


    Add rack plan layout and warehouse staff is an **optional** process. Because
    when you have finished the migration process, those settings are already set
    in your account. But if you want to add the new rack layout or change your
    default warehouse staff, you can use this API.
