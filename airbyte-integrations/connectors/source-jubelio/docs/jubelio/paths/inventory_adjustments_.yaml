  summary: Create/Edit Stock Adjustment
  description: >
    This API is used to create/edit adjustment stock. To get **bin_id**, you can
    use
    [GET/wms/default-bin/{location_id}](https://docs-wms.jubelio.com/#operation/getWMSDefaultBin)
    or
    [GET/locations/bin/{location_id}](https://docs-wms.jubelio.com/#operation/getBinbyLocationID).
    If you don't set your rack plan since the very beginning when moving to
    Jubelio WMS, your default **bin_id** will be automatically set.
