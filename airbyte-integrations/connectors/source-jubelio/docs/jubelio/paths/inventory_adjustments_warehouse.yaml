  summary: Create/Edit Stock Adjustment in the Warehouse
  description: >
    Use this endpoint to create/edit stock adjustment in your warehouse. To get
    **bin_id**, you can use
    [GET/wms/default-bin/{location_id}](https://docs-wms.jubelio.com/#operation/getWMSDefaultBin)
    or
    [GET/locations/bin/{location_id}](https://docs-wms.jubelio.com/#operation/getBinbyLocationID).
    If you don't set your rack plan since the very beginning when moving to
    Jubelio WMS, your default **bin_id** will be automatically set.
